# Project Euler Problem #4
# Largest palindrome product
#  Problem 4
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Strategy: Count down from largest possible number
#			  and check to see if it's a palindrome.
